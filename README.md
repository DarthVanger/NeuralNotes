Neural Notes
-----------
App to work with notes & files in a mind map view [https://neural-notes.com](https://neural-notes.com)

The files are saved to Google Drive.

There is no DB, it's just files:
- every node on mind map is a folder
- basically it's a folder tree displayed as a mind map
- notes are just txt files inside the folders

## Launch locally
